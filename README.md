# SAROMAN

## About

SAROMAN (SAtellite Route and Orbit MAppiNg tool) is a tool to calculate and plot satellite ground tracks using their TLE (Two Line Element) Set and a given time frame. The software was developed as part of a students project for engineering students at the Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig (technical university of Brunswick).

## Functions

Multiple ground tracks may be plotted in multiple colors. If desired, the ground track can alternatively be drawn with a color gradient representing the satellites speed (red = slow, yellow = fast), which scales based on the satellites minimum and maximum speed.

## Libraries used

The following libraries were used in this project:
* SGP4
* Astropy
* PySimpleGUI
* Matplotlib
* Tkinter
* numpy
